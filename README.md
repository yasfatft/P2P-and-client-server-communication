# Socket Programming
## Python
TCP client-server & UDP P2P file-sharing implementation in Python3 related to computer networks' course I passed previous semester. I also upload the assessment description to help understand the structure of the project better. The first project is TCP one and the second one is P2P. The projects are comment full & will guide you completely through executing them.
## C
Here is a TCP client-server connection implementation with the ability to handle simultaneous clients' requests. I used child process & also forked system call as an isolated environment for each client connection. It includes the assessment too because it was part of a task for the Operating system course that I was a teacher assistant of.
